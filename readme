 2. For create and insert a new element into the DOM first we have to use document.createElement(tagName) to create a new element. Then we need to add text,html and other attribute then we need to select a parent element and then attach the new element by append().

 3.event bubbling us a type of event in the dom where an event triggered on a child element and is handled by its ancestor elements

 4. in event delegationwe can attach a single event listener to a parent element.it is usefull because here we dont have to add hundreds of listeners to a child elements we can only add one listener to the parent. For this we can save memory and improves preformance.

 5. preventDefault() stops the browserâ€™s default action for an event and stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up or capturing down the DOM.
